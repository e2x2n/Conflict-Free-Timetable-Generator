# Schedule Creator

## _Introduction_
This Java desktop application can simplify the process of creating personal or professional schedules. 
Users can input a variety of tasks along with their durations and available time slots, 
and the application will generate a conflict-free timetable. 
This tool is designed to help users efficiently manage their time, 
avoid scheduling conflicts, and prioritize tasks effectively. 
It's particularly interesting as it combines algorithmic problem-solving with practical, everyday utility.
